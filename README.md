# Car Rental System CLI using OOPs Principles

This project implements a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Car Rental System in Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for efficient management of car rentals.

## Features

- **Renting and Returning Cars:** Users can rent available cars and return them after use.
- **Feedback Management:** Customers can leave feedback about their rental experience.
- **Inventory Display:** Detailed information about available cars including brand, model, year, color, and mileage.
- **Basic Filtering:** Functionality to filter cars by brand or model.

## Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation:** Car and Customer classes encapsulate their respective data and behaviors.
- **Inheritance:** Possible use of inheritance for different types of cars or customers (not shown in the provided code).
- **Polymorphism:** Methods like `calculatePrice()` demonstrate polymorphic behavior based on the specific car type.
